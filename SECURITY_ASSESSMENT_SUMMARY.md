## 📊 Test Results Framework

### **Vulnerability Detection**
```php
// Example: SQL Injection Test
$vulnerabilities = $this->testSqlInjection('/api/medical-records', [
    'patient_id' => $patient->id,
    'diagnosis' => 'test_value'
]);

// Example: IDOR Test
$vulnerabilities = $this->testIdorVulnerabilities(
    '/api/patients/{id}', 
    $patient->id, 
    $unauthorizedUser
);
```

### **HIPAA Compliance Scoring**
```php
// Compliance score calculation
$score = 100 - (Weighted Violations × 5)
// Critical: Weight × 4, High: Weight × 3, Medium: Weight × 2, Low: Weight × 1
```

### **Report Generation**
```bash
# Run complete security assessment
./scripts/security-assessment.sh
